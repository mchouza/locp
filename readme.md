# LOCP (Low Overhead CSV Parser)

## Introduction

This is a CSV parser in development, following the principle that the fastest code is the code that is not executed. In its present state is neither very fast nor very featured, only supporting unquoted and unpadded CSV fields and using naive code to split the fields.
